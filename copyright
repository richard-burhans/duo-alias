 Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
 making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
 conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
 combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
 permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
 modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
 terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
 independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
 module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
 based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this
 exception to your version of the library, but you are not obliged to
 do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
 from your version.
